= Sofware assurance thru DevSecOps
Bradley Lanford
SME on SwA and SW
Leads senior eng team 

* Warno: STARTED with high hopes IN ABSTRACT
** BUT this is highlights

== Summary (SwA in DevSecOps)
* DoD tranisiton 
** 30 orgs!
* DoD 5000.83 -- "TEch and PP to maintain TEch Adv"
* DevSecOPs capes mature -- and we ALL move -- BUT  must ensure the implementation
** cirtical components
** move toward automation

== SwA in DEvSecOps
* Some PAST years examples
* It's a pick-up game

* Alignment of SwA 
** Early LOOK with DoD REf Arch was coming out -- so SwA was aligned!
** Automation to INCREASE assurance
** This ENABLES DEvSecOps MORE RAPIDLY
** WHAT where artifacts were able to be generated?
** Dashboard this info to enable 
* Completion of SwA in DevSecOps whitepaper "commpuity of practices 
** Aim to revisit the white paper
* Dev of DAU WSA 002 - DEvSecOps for the DoD Security Focus (DSF)

== SwA Assurance Gaps 2020
* "the EXACT slide" years ago -- STILL applicable

* Hardened Container SRG
** JFAC Techical WG on hardening
** ID what the more rigiours measures we are following
* Assurance Baseline
** Know the baseline, BUT find critical items needed
* Sw Threat modeling
** CAN be done early in programs, but kinda lacking in SwA
** Not many tools
** When looking on DE community: HOW do we automate it?
* Data Strategy
** LOTS of data is produced -- applies ti SwA space
* Risk Catagorization
** Prioritization and autmoation to MOVE OUT FASTER on remiediation
* Open Source
** Redhat++ (navy and AF efforts)
** Looking at it on R&E

== Scope of DEvSecOps
* Highlight of 30+ factories!
* Implication of different (100s) pipelines (new or using)
* THOUSANDS of contracts -- causing deviation

==

== Relation to Indistry
* Highlight there are many linkages
* BUT there's a wide variety!
** One Vendor might be making application layer only
** Some vendors might bring their OWN infrastructure
** THIS CHANGES Security baseline/posture!
* Knowing things (e.g., infrastructure as code) helps inform the (need) for security posture
** what do inheirt vs. what EXTRA items are needed

== CI/CD Pipeline
THIS implies STRIGHT TO static analysis

Point: layout the pipeline, and talk about what can be done "at each gate"

== SwA
* There are GREAT tools to enable automation 
** and the TOOLS might focus on function of the software -- BUT we can/could leverage for cyber/assurance needs!

== The REAL Tool Story
* Case: "Hey ... you should being SwA!; answer: 'what's that?' "
** So boiling it down -- they find a tool for static and dynamic analysis
** 
* 
* Vuln scanning tools: MOST common
** Java Static Analysis -- that's 10 tools
*** you'd THINK it'd be more; and freely
** BUT as you go down the list -- it shrink
** Custom created tools in some cases (e.g., Go and ADA)
** First LOOK: it's ABUNDANT!
*** BUT tools scan for different things
*** can quickly get down to just a couple of choices
** THUS the pipeline 
*** predicated on knowing what/how to react to finding
(LLNA Levi Roy? -- Author?)

== Level of Assurance
* Capes are brought from MANY places (or vendors)
* Types of Sw and Languages
** impacts/drives need for 
** This drives criticality need
*** Maybe NOT ALL tools agsint ALL code -- but the critical elements
** Diferrent levels of rigor
*** 10K's vs. 100K's 
* System integration lab
** what WAS pre-prodiction -- you instead could bring more HW/digital twins
*** provides same inputs and outputs
*** more rigous testing, ideally NOT impacting speed (given automation)

== PPP O&G SwA Table Mapping to DSO
* DRASTIC CHANGES EXPECTED from the 2011 Table to what's being updated in 2022
* Currently 8 tables
* PUTTING TOGETHER DIDS!
** across the Lifecycle
** what data comes out of the pipline, and how that transfers to 
** 

=== Table Reviews
* MORE TOOLS with automation (with even more types)
* Automated artifacts are made -- but looking at how to answer:
** how are we mitigating this?
** What manual proccesses are needed?
* Microservices can enable/waive certain requirements
** Ex: Rust has "built in" protections based on it's design, versus something like C, so can LESS testing

== Sumamry
* 
* Acquisiton Process and contractual relationship to industry partners create boundaries NOT present in commerical sw dev --
* Welcome feedback, since this is NOT 

Question: Levels of Assurance


My: 
1) No-code -- 
2) DIDS driving Contract Data Rights
3) Does this approach drive specific needs for Dev approaches; TDD is great/would enabled CD/CI pipeline -- COSTLY! Programs avoid it!
