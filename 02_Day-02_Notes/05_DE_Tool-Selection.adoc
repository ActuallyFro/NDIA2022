= Digital Engienrring Tool Selection Criteria

Jeff Naratez, Emily Bak, Frank Salavartore

Inherently Governmental Functions -- "I approve!"

* This is A WIP!
* this is JUST Scrutching the surface!
** Aim to find specific criteria, to help drive DE implementors a resource

== Agenda

== Puprose & Scope
DE BOK -- has 9 elements
DE Guidebook has FUNDAMENTAL knowledge Areas

* SO WHAT? -- looking to improve vendor/tool interoperability

== Approach 

== POAM
* INCOSE will be the target for release in MAY

== Criteria Alignment
* semi-painful -- but looking at tDE Strategy (it's 5 goals)
* However, extracting important facts/criteria
** "need help to develop models" -- CAN MEAN A LOT
*** This is the work that is still being accomplished
** Goal 3: Technological innovation (AI, ML)
*** To what extent does a tool enable that?
*** Need to know -- so we can understand how it supports "your" DE ecosystem

== DE Fundamentals
* IF YOU ARE doing DE -- but not doing tese fundamental things, then you _might_ want to relook at activities to date
* originalyl formed in 2012 (or hertigage thereof)
* As strategy for DE came out, the team is going back to update that 
* LATEST "v1" Feb 2021

=== Established DE Fundamentals Snapshots
* SOME are "no brainers" -- BUT aim to have clear articulation
** Eg: support modeling and/or simulation
** This can help encourage thinking on "what is needed for 'my' ecosystem"

== DE Ecosystem REq's
* DEBoK Link ()
* Needs
** Data Storage
** Security

Question (from me) -- DAU, for example, has great "cheat sheet tools" on the Web (example: the old M-DID and NEW AAF-DID) [Question] Has the group thought about such an "interactive" capability for the planned guidance?

ANSWER: (classic .. "on the next slide") de-bok.org 

== Next steps
* Look for feedback!
* Sharing/tool stealing!
* Any/all help is appreciated!
* OSUD will be doing an internal review
* INCOSE IW in the spring

== Q&A Session
* Q: AAF-DID/M-DID -- NO interactive tool yet planned
**

* Q: What scope will the level work? Bring it up to 
** A: Enterprise, versus program/project level

* Q: Open standards and Integration?
** A: Will be considered (LOOK at "Sample Criteria - As Factors Slide" 

* Q: PREVENT HOLY WARS on tools?
** 

* Q: Avoid "NOT invented here" Mentality

* Q: Tool management?
** A: It'd be great to use this information/guidance/knowledge to help decide/implement tools.
*** There will be fights on which/how/why
*** If you are consistent consideration of which DE decisions are made -- and enterprise to enterprise --
*** But this is likely just guidance, and it's prescriptive but orgs can decide for themselves

* Q: Integration of Data
** A: not understanding of scope -- pushed to offline

* Q: Cross-referenced agasint INCOSE tools DB?
** No: but is planned!

* Q: Data Export standards -- how does the criteria defining it?
** Taken offline

* Wieghts planned?

* DTIC DeBOK -- reach out to email 
osd.mc-alex.osud-r-e.mbx.deboksupport@mail.mil

* Q: Developer tools that are NOT friendly? Planned integration
** not enough time!
