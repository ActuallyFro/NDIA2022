= Achieving MOSA Benefits A Decision Framework For Choosing MOSA Metrics

Subtitle: What questions should we be asking?

How do you know success?

"What gets measured, gets done" --> "What gets measured, and acted upon, gets done" (correction from his son)

OSD Site: DoD MOSA -- things to think about in the MOSA Ecosystem

MOSA tenants: (arrows 


BUSINESS OUTCOMES -- that's what we measure -- in the MOSA Benefits

== Measurement Slection/Tailoring Lessons Learned
* "Why does the Pentagon want this?
* Bottomline -- 4 goals in working with stakeholders + design/engineering team

== Sample MOSA Benefit MEasurement Use Cases
* Each will be covered
* Osprey Nest (NOT THE AIRPLANE)
** Ft Beflord
* Example: Modular Design -- need a Forrest, need twigs, need a location 
** "Rich ones" up on cable"
** Tech refresh
** Benefit: raise the NEXT generation of chicks

== How do we measure the Benefits of the SW REsue
* NOT jsut the code
** Models
** Reuse of design (studies show 27% reduction)
** Other metrics

= Global Air Traffic Managment (GATM) Mission Needs and MOSA Business Cases
* DEFINED requirements
* 

=== GATM System-of-sytem SPO CONOPS
* There can be organizational Enabling Processes
** Cost savings
** Tech refresh (a little as 24 hours)
*** Implies spares/parts
* Underpinning MOSA tenents enabled -- since NOT ALL items/considerations are technical

=== What were the GATM Stakeholder MOSA Success Metrics

=== SE Life Cycle
* How do you use SE AND Agile at the SAME time!?
* 15-288.2 -- What are the MOSA
* Looking across 
** Mission Engineering Analysis intersection
** CID REport -- 11 or 12 
** What's important
** What's the risk

== Archtiecture
* At PDR? SDR?
* MAKE it a REQUIREMENT! 
** Army is doing it right
** Question how much MBSE are we doing?
** Level of modularity? Support replacements plan? 
* MOSA and Operation Capability 

== System Analysis
How do you compete?
** Is it continued competition? Is it just a single event/part?
* Some other core questions:
** Incentives?
** Opportunites?
** HAVING both enables an ability to compete

== Interoperability
* Meterics need to be chose based on risk/concerns/how you plan to manage

== MOSA Metrics Selection Process
* Increasing competition
** How long?
** Objectives?
* TOP is resources
* BOTTOM: links of/to defined metrics
** NOT everything is measured
** DON'T reinvent the wheel

== Current Status - MOSA Metrics 
* Dr. Raygan is ALSO on this team
* Putting together a SUPERSET of meterics -- and provide it to the comunity
** BUT critical thinking is still needed!

== Summary Chart
GATM case
L&M Crtieria *(suggested)
Cost Estimating
Sw Re-use

* Question: there are different levels of progress; How do this? 
** One size-fits-all does NOT work -- BUT know what can be rolled-up

* Q2: For established metrics, is there a resource for measurement error?

GITHUB COPILOT
** Dr. Raygan: there is a resource for this -- but it's not a "one size fits all" -- it's a "one size fits most" -- and it's a "one size fits most" for a specific domain
