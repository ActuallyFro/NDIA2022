= Design Code Basis for Secure Cyber Reslient Engieering
* Look 
== Agenda

== Need
* Stakeholder: "I want this cape"
** "our job" -- ID the critieria NEEDED
* DESIGN CODE will assist in develpoing 

== History of Design Code
* Marie Antoninette -- "there's nothing new, just what's forgotten"
* TCSEC -- the ORANGE BOOKS
* NSA had it's uniform guidance (see Type 1) -- lays down criteria/aspects
** 1991 National Research Counicl "Computers at Risk and Safe Computing" (sp -- something like that)

== Design Code Basis for SCRE (Concept)
* getting after requrirements that may, or may not, have been stated
* looking to enable to give protection to MEET 5000.83!

== SCRE Design Code
* Specifically looked at points in the 5000.83

It's a security anonmaly until measured/eval'ed

== Protection Nuclues
* it's not is STRICTLY security
* Key protection functions
** Deliver capes -- but assuring it dows what it needs
** Protect DATA!
* Two core capabilities
** Mediated Access
** System Control 

== Design Code Criteria Dev
* 

== Next Steps
* Usable and Understandable

Question: is this becoming a DID?

Looking at Section L and Section M...
WE NEED additonal DIDS and language to support the SCRE Design Code

== Q&A | Open Discussion

* Current guidance:
** Relation to 800-160; v3? -- or how can we integrated it into NIST guidance
** Systems Security Criteria (as seen in INCOSE)
** REALLY AFTER: DATE!
*** WORKING ON IT

* Aim: how do you incoprate requirments INTO design specification
** NIST guidance is a broad range of guidance
** DAU Secuire REsilient Comptentcy
** Cross domain solution -- it's to challenge they way we think about security. ID needs. etc.

* There is SO MUCH information
** 160 || 161
** Volume 1 had a "ok" integration -- but more work and SCRE is needed

* INCOSE -- SSE
** Can we can something "as a handbook" (Desirement)

* WE have "the RMF" DID (Techincal Report DID -- NOT even a specifc)
** Ideally -- MULTIPLE (or tailorable)
*** Tailor implies a NEED a for a Workbook

* RMF is driving us, and that where's the money is going
** "just get rid of it" is NOT the answer

* Intent: a DID for EACH security speciality?
** That's part of this difficulty!
** ID this as a DE challenge -- and FUNCTIONAL challenge for the community
