=  Capability-Based Security Engineering for Strategy Formulation and Stakeholder Alignment

== Cability based System Security Engineering
* Stake holder alignment! 
** They are NOT the ones to listen to -- BUT they can effect
** WANT to be engaged in the mission of security
* Need want, awareness 

TAKE SE members and GO LEARN 

What is MVP with Security team?
** NOT ask Encryprion expertise
** BUT understand security thinkin/arch/sttate

* CAN CAUSE ALIGNMENT of the team

== Loss-driven Engineering
WANT them to really think on "this project" and ID what we CANNOT LOSE

== Modeling Tristworhtiness
* RETURN to OLDEN DAYS
** Mathematically risk based statemnts
** We want EVIDENCE based solutions
* Bottomline -- is the BOTTOMLINE

== Security as a functional requirement 
* WHAT do we pay attention to?
** FUNCTIONAL REQURIEMENTS
** IF secuirty IS NOT a functional requirement -- it's LIKELY ignored by SE's
* Leveraging Loss-Driven needs -- then we can clearly communicate 

== Security Orchtestration
* WANT to use old solutions, CURRENT solutions
* Need: WAHT IS the CURRENT sittuation
* BOTTOMLINE -- is the Bottomline

* Security of the moment -- what's going on, avoid it
** LIKELY WE DO NOT IT TO BE the focus/ what's going on
** They are operating at cyberspeeds -- "So do we"

== Collaborative Mutual Protection
* aregge to a collective for (mutal) protection
* Separate agent that is watching what's going on -- asking "are we, or they, doing hte right thing"
** each have a list -- not all the same thing -- BUT distrubuted cape (when collected) is good

== ARchitectual Agility
* Bottomline -- is the BOTTOMLINE


== Operational Agility
*asking to handover C2 to enable FASTER THAN NORMAL speeds

* BOTTOMLINE -- is the Bottomline

= Education 

* HOW ARE WE every going to end up with a securityu provifiency on the SE team
** AT an apprpirate level
** with respect and LISTEN to SE team
* Such that it's AGNOSTIC

* Good Metrics -- best education, "people that don't have a clue" --> DO NOT have to be an EXPERT
** seeking COMMON SENSE on Loss-driven effects
** NOT NEEDED to be a tactical expert 

== Holoistic
* We need transdisciplinary -- to SPAN a wide range of different stakeholder
* "on my left" ... "which is your left too"

!!! COMMON LANGAUGE IS LOSS-DRIVEN NEEDS !!! (away from the podium IMPORTNAT!)

== SQAURE (proof of conecpt) Secuirty Quality REquirements Engineering
* Req's engineering IS KEY
* they have ?9? steps -- WHAT we have to do tactically to MAKE it occur
** WE DO NOT NEED the last 7!
** They have a method to GET stakeholder alignment
** Case studies
* I WANT CASE STUDIES! 
** If anyone can help

Goals and needs !=

* Steps
** 1. can taxonomy and defintions
*** 70/80 terms
*** they asked WHAT they thought words mean (allows insight into knowledge and lack thereof)
*** It allows ALLIGNEMENT/collaboration
** 2. 

== SE Vision 2035
* WANT to make Cybersecurity embedded as concepts of safety
