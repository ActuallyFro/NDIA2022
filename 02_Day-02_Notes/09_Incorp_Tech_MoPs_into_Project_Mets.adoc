= Incorporating Techincal MEasures of Oerformance into Project Metrics

* Extending from Original work in 1997

== Contents
* Measuring
* Incorporating Meachuers
* Integrating MoPs
* Putting it into Practice

* Example: NON-traditional program -- there's NO end deliverables -- it's a teaming to integrate perdormance into 2025-2030
** Knowing defintion of "done"
** DO NOT explictly need Earned Value
* But for programs with lots of Risk -- that infomration can be captured (via IMS)
** Used as a leading edge Identifier
* This can leverage digitized documents (e.g., DOORS)


== Meacuring Tech Work
KEY QUESTION: What defines DONE
* What are the framing assumptions (via Goals and objectives)
** Provides Feedback loop
** CAN ID if we've exceeded the framing assumptions

== Key Elements
* MUST ID KPPs, MoPs, and MoEs 
** Each tracks a different aspect OF the techincal aspects
** Drives a time-phased plan
*** Id's progress 
*** Range of acceptable outcomes that are RISK derived

== Performance vs. Effectiveness
* Programs that have large FOCUS on Techincal Performance -- 

== Practical Processes and Outputs
* WBS Dictionary -- bring 

=== IMP
* first STEP -- lay down IMP
* Event, Accomplishment, and Criteria

--> ENABLES the developement of the IMS
* created via the IMP process

== Develop the Plans and Scheulde to Reach 
USE of democratized DAta -- for business Intelligence

* Techincal Measurement or Perfroamnce Plan
** Provide the time- or eve-based plan of anticipated (and actual) achievem of techincal parameters

* Elements of Measurement (list)

USING IMS's to ensure/track when time-to-market will be hit


== Create a Technical Measure or Performance Plan - The INCOSE model
* "everything in the universe is a sequence of probabilities with limits of freewill (bounded)"
