= Software Assurance Roadmap

Mr. Steve Grice
Techincal Director, Software Assurance

* This is PLAN -- you make it so you have something to deviate from ;)

== Software Sssurance
* Defined: SwA -- PL112-239 (2013) -- in NDAA for 2013's Section 933
** Problems and difficulties -- "level of cofidence" -- INTENT: Software is working 'as intended', free of vulnerabilities
*** Free in Dev of CODE
*** Architectural designs are remidiated/fixed
*** This highlights the challenge of dev'ing free of vulns (e.g., given/needed a well trained workforce)

=== Activities to date:
* Dev of polices
* JFAC (see Day 1 #10)
* JFAC Technical Working Group
** Engage from the techincal side!
** Every otherweek
** See what's coming "out of the labs"
** gives awareness/up and coming issues 
* DoD/National Nucear Security Admin
* Partnerships w/ DHA, NNSA, NSA, and Industry (thru NDIA)
** Sharing: opened eyes to possibilities (e.g., NSA) Assurance Levels help educate community

== Strategic Vision
* Impotus this year -- in FEB '22 (1 Feb 22) Ms. Heidi Shyu -- "Technology Vision for an Era of Competition"
** Are we doing hte right thing?
** Creating the workforce of tomorrow?

*Technology Stratgey Pillars
** Mission Focus
** Foundation Building
** Critical Technology Areas

=== Critical Technology Areas
* Effecitive Adption Areas
** Trusted AI andAutnomy
** Microelectrons
** ADvanced Computing & Software
* Seed Areas of Emerging Opportinity
** Biotech
** Quantum Science
** Future Gneration Wireless Tech
* Defense-sepcific 
** Directed Energy
** Hyper sonics

* Notes
** White paper is out for SwA tools "tool" -- gaps, finding ways to invest in better areas/
** We CANNOT wait to "see what happens", then apply the policy/TTPS/paths forward -- so they are reaching out/getting ahead of the curve (e.g., Quantum)
*** BEst practicies in Coding

=== Current, Ongoing, and RElevant Topics
* Sofware Bill of Materials (SBOM)
** A primary focus to capture -- whitepapers
** WO 14028 "Improiving nat's cyber
** FY __ NDAA 1655
* DevSecOps
* Exsiting Tool Maturation
** Coor with vendors, S&T orgs,
** PD Cuber and LLNL collab
* Software Assurance Metrics (METRICS THAT MATTER!)
** Dev of metricis to support policy  and guidance implementation
** Nuclear Enterprise Assurance Workshop

== SwA Roadmap
* Plan for FY2022
* Focus Areas FY23 - FY25
* Outcomes FY26-30

Protecting Emerg Tech
Mat Exist Capes
Securing SW Dev
Advacing hte State of Practice

== SwA Rm -- Emerging Technologies
* Emdedded SW - Limited Capes to analyze em
** Included FPGAS (e.g., Xlinx mentioned)
** NSA leading HW/SW assurance Pilot
** Looking chip level  
* AI & Autonomy -- Limited understanding of oim]pacts and protections
* Quantum -- Limited understanding of (missed)

== Maturing Exiting Caps
* SWA Toolset -- Programs do NOT have access to SwA tools to inform decision making 
** Look at JFAC's tool catalog (aim to have it on the Portal)
** Lawernce Livermore == LL?
*** Did studies
*** have 350+ 
**** Characterics
**** Features
*** Aim: share to BETTER INFORM community
* Workforce -- Existing expertise is limited and DoD lacks training for guture frowth
** This is reucrring things -- "oh they were trained 10 years ago, we're set!" (false!)
** Sofware Assurance Credentialing Program
** Posturing to help maintain certification
* Metrics -- Lack of metrics to inform continous imoprovies of SwA Activities

== Securing Sw Dev
* SBOM -- prgrams do NOT have processies , tool, or guidance to support SBOM req's
** BAck in the day: Version Description Documents were made "and were set"
*** Future: make it Machine Readible version -- THEN this can be leveraged to ID and share impact based on vulnerabilities 
** Defining NTIA, minimum essential elements
** It can provide a WEALTH of knowledge to help enable SwA TTPs in the future
* DevSecOps -- guidance LACKS sofware assurance (Fro: I like -- but BOLD! :D)
* Open Source -- Lack of meterics to inform continous imporvements of SwA activities
** DEv of Secure Open Source REccomendations REport (present?)
** NEA Worksop Aussraince Metrics tRack
** Short term: DoD Assurance Metrics Pilot
** Longterm: Define core set of metrics
** Examples: Log4j, OpenSSL
*** FUN FACT: New OpenSSL vulmn equivalent to HEARTBLEED


== Advancing the State of Practices
* Partnerships -- DoD IS NOT fully aligned with UGA on assurance apporach and sharing
** New workship and DoDA/NNSA SwA CoP
** Devel JOINT road made
** Goal: ALign DHS S&T / NSA & NNSA efforts
* SwA Platform (JFAC) -- SwA REsources have limited access to expertise and tools requeired
* S&T Innovation -- lack awaresness of and infrastracute to transition assrance S&T

== Summary
* What movitated us? Ms. Shyu's memo
* DoD has seen GREAT success with SwA tools, plolices, instructions and guielines -- BUT landscape is ALWAYS changing
* Dod is lookging for INPUT and FEEDBACK from NDIA

Questions


* Q1: Timeline for tool assessment and selection process?
** A: this is algined to modernized JFAC portal
*** Tools basedlined in JFAC discussion
*** Looked at YEARLY
*** JFAC team then uses it for investements/paths forward
* Q2: Expand on: Integrated sensing and office
** This was JUST started
* Q3: Vision for Trusted AI and Autonomy?
** A: We just started! :')
*** BUT core work is with JFAC team! (minimum the sharing via JFAC)
