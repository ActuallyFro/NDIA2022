= Method for Developing SoS Architectures Using SysML Model Federation
Chris

== Customers are calling for DE for Systems Develpoment

MBSE 1.0 -- PICTURES
MBSE 2.0 -- DATA focused!

* Tools and approaches are NOT necessarily apporachable

== Problem Statement
* Essential challenge: connectivity
** Multiple indepdent entities, which mostly
* Multple PARTS describe the TOTAL solution

== Types od SoS applicable for federation
* Managerial and Operational elements

* Managerial Independent
** They are consitutent
** BUT are complex enough to have thiwer own model
* COMBAT systems are a good example 
** Senors, Weapons, Organizations, Total Integration 
** This "simple" out line can be VERY challenging

== Approaches of the Past
* Develope Indpendent architecture models -- we are building DIFFERENT things, but might have commonablities (share data, interfaces)
** Systems-of-Systems: PEOPLE in the gray matter are connecting dots
* Integrated Architecture Model
** ONE MODEL to rule them all!
** FLEXIBILITY is lost!
** DIFFICULT to integrate deltas and changes
** Likely HARD to combine muilt-models
* Develope SoS Model using a FRAMEWORK
** DoDAF
** MODAF
** UPDM
** BUT when you do the models -- nothing is enforced -- Frameworks AREN'T Maintained -- it's an indpendedent model
** Can OFTEN create a CHECK list mentality
*** Sometimes it's a neccesary evil

== Suggestion! SysML federation for drective modeling -- as a federatioed appraoach
* Pick your tool! Cameo Rhapsody
* Binding content in a COMMON Library that can be leveraged by ALL
** Loosely copuled 
** Content can be leveraged by 
** Ensures that the Systems of Systems contect stays updated/relvant

* RELLAY important -- there's an asycilic nature (non-cycle) of the graph

== Foundations of the approach 
-- Login-walled

== Applicable SysML content included with Federation
SoS Behavioral Content - Behavior, Logical, Physical

== Surrogates used as a substitue for adjacent system blocks
Surrogates provide a black box representation of peer system vloacks for use in OTHER peer models

* Concepts: we don't want a BUNCH of cross-mounting (causing a CYCLE)
** 1 Million cycles/dependecy -- that have a REAL WORLD impact on performance
* Through realization (and model validation) surrogates are aligned wth their system blocks
* Able to check for:
** missing ports
** mistyped ports
** mismatched conjugations

== Realization as the cross-model key
* ALL three pictures show the SAME thing (interface)
** without validation (and relazation relationships)
*** validation rules can check message signals 

== Overcoming style non-compliance and protecting data
* talk to 5 people -- get 6 WAYS to build a model
** "Micromodel" -- imples a SMALL way to describe a black box
***  this gets tricky and perialous (sp)  (the purple box on slide 12) -- a custom validation suite is creaed to confirm the system n Micromodel content is in complete alignment with tSystem n model content

== USN example

* "I really REALLY perfer people to be able to use the models I build ;)"
** 

== USSAF
TWO levels of common library model -- it applies a micro model paradigm

== Tailored approach for classified program
* interesting issue: classfied
* top level content is SAIC style 
MIGHT be a good way to leverage micro model and acyclic approach to HELP!
