= Competency Based Education
You STAND on a Podium -- you present BEHIND a lectern

== CBE
* It's STUDENT CENTRIC -- to fill in THEIR GAPS
* VS. TEACHER based "I the teacher deem you need to learn all this material"
* Ken Barker -- at NDIA -- talking to Competnencies
* The issue: DELIVERY MODALITY!

== 2017 - AFIT Partnership
* Started as Graduate Research project
* ID'ed "Education Hub" (Dr. Mark Rieth)
** Sprint at USAFA
** Use social media type capes (e.g., Khan Academy) -- BUT behind CUI-wall

== Old: Cyber Education Hub
* Great community asset -- YouTube like
* It was targeted to be the "home" for CBE

== Then - to - now
* Cyber Education Hub
* 2019 "Acquistion Hub" or Education Hub
* Avovle

* Allows to share and implement Lessons Learned
** "Does it? It USUALLY means Lessons Documented" ;)

== AVOLVE
* Took Cyber Education Hub -- moved from Tiles of Education
* Put it on CloudOne -- at IL4 level
* Still enabling User Generated Content
** Crowdsourced content to supplement existing courses
* Take content and STRING TOGEHTER (like MOOC's -- Massive Online Open Courses)
** to create Learning Paths

== Learning Paths
* You DO NOT have to interact with every-piece-of-content
* User drives what they interact with
* This would enable CBE
* ISSUE: DoD WANTS
** DO NOT measure "completions" -- BUT/rather engagement with content items
** Measure views vs.

== Future Capes
* Gamification

== Q&A
* Q: Governance for quality?
* Q: WHAT incentives do users have to interact?

Question: "Non-blue Check" Learning Paths --
* AFSOC can make content -- but have to ask "mother may I"
** Thoughts: can a "non-blue check" (think twitter) type, Learning Path Development Cape, be given?
