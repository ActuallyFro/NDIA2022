SME on Sw, SwA for Acquisition and PPP

Supports Ms. Melinda Reed -- he's covering for the WG

== SBOM Project Effort - Contributors 
* Met about 1/mo
* Cory Ocker (Lead for the track in SSE)

== CAtalyst
* EO inspired
* Trying to lay down how a purchasor could lay flat Sw req's/needs

== Timeline 
* Feb 2021 -- DevSecOps Conference -- work at NTIA
* Since April Draft + DIDs
* October -- ID'ed 12 Attributes (July previous were minimum elements)

== Use Case Perspective (Dec 21)
* Goal: focuse HOW the SBOM would be used
* ID'ed three main players: dev, integrator, tester
** Bottom up, how it's implemented, security risks/vulns
** Known risks, alternative components, up thru obselecnes
** USER of the SBOM, and potential contributor -- critical operational threads -- DEV test moreso than OPs test

== Developer Sw Capes
* Open Source played into this!

== DEfinition TEster
* Key: HOW is the product being used in the system
* Know if there's enough details in the SBOM for testing

== Dr. Friedman's Perspective 
* Summary slide from presention -- TOOLING is still emerging
* "How it will work" -- has NOT been tested!
* **NOT ALL VULNs PUT ORGS AT RISK!!!**
* CANNOT assume we will get full automation immediately

==  SBOM takeaways
* EXPANDED on (14208 expanded greatly) minimum
* NO standardization for Formats and outputs
* Lots of Known Unknows

== Considerations and next steps
* Was NOT the singular focus
* ID'ed what is necessairy VS. the meta data (Minimum need vs. nice to haves)

== Updated SBOM DID -- internal comments
* EXPAND upfront text -- to give context and detail on what the DID
* CHOSE XML/Machine-reable generic format -- versus are particular container

== Revised SBOM DID 
* Final stages in draft
* LARGER group will be notified soon

==  
Standardize vs. Generic

== Path Forward 
* FAR language as regulatory langaune (
* Q: "Stagnation Avoidance" (is it a ONE and done for the program; or more often)
** Aim to have it be automated
* Tracking CVE's separately
* Q: "Trust but verify" play into this?
** A: NEED Validation! 

* Audits and assessments with BOM's -- so being mindful with Software
** Google AND Microsoft have "artifact" collection methods
