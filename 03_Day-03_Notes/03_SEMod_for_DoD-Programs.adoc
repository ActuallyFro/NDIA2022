= Systems Engineering Modernization (SEMod) Key Enablers for System Development on DoD Programs

== 

== SEMod Focus Areas?
* KEY enabler: configuration management (as a course!)

== Exmplar Digital Acquition Thread Collaborator
* WSE 027 MOSA -- from PEO: wanted a workshop -- now it's an examplar for education/quick turn
** Missing TEchincal Configuration Management (Logs and MAnagement -- NOT TECH)
* Mission Engineering -- is BIG, DEEP, and WIDE -- BUT they have deployed a new workshop
* Upcoming
** MBSE - target in Spring
** DE Ecosystem -- next year

Question: "Non-blue Check" Learning Paths -- 
* AFSOC can make content -- but have to ask "mother may I"
** Thoughts: can a "non-blue check" (think twitter) type, Learning Path Development Cape, be given?

== Results
* Highlights thru the list
* MOSAs education needed

== Example: Configuration Management in Digital Domain?
* TIL (Today I Learned): NAVY has warrant holders FOR config management

== Product Life Cycle Management?
* Note the placeholder!
* There's LOTS of discussion -- everything is in dev
* We are TRYING 

* DATA ALL THE THINGS!
** There are "massive webs" of connections
** DAU is the "authorative source" for Policy (AAF portal, and AAFDID|MDID)
** What/how to we map the EDUCATION TO THOSE resources!?
