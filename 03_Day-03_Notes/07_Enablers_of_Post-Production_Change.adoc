* Looking at Case studies!

== Research Motivation
* LOTS of systems have LONG, PROTRACTED development cycles
* Idea to Fieled -- 20+ YEARS
** IMPLIES that the environement it was fieled to CHANGES

== Design for Changeability (DfC)
*Look at: Flexibility vs. Robustness
** FOCUSED ON Flexibility 
** ROBUST systems are quite hard!

== Enablers of Changeability
** Modulariry
** Margin -- excess of a system property (e.g., Power Generation on Ships)
** CONOPs -- You LEAVE form -- but change it's use -- to enable to get new capes (e.g., A screwdrive can be used for MORE than a screwdriver)

== What about Post Production Gap
* there's a GAP of understanding HOW our systems change
* This is where they are looking at...

== Case Study
* Hopefully NOT contributions
* NOT look at A/B/c
* Only three -- due to time

== ORIGINAL requirements
* C-130A exceeds requirement for payload, range, and power
** "THEY CHEATED" ;) 
*** Requirement was "one engine out" -- they can lose two
*** ONLY design that submitted A FOUR ENGINE DESIGN

== Arctic Operations

== Navy

== Space

== Modularity
* It's NOT perfectly modular
** You need to leverage margin
** Often it was excess power
** We aren't REALLY understanding -- because Modularity is enabled by Margin -- we don't "know" what enables it in total

== CONOPS Innovation
* It's NOT really the silver bullet

==
YOU CANT really jsut strap on things into Steath Aircraft

== New frontiner
* CYBER CHANGES -- these can impact physical world
