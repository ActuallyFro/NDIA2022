= Program Protection and Secure Cyber Resilient Engineering Initiatives

== Speaker 

Melinda Reed
Director, Systems Security
Office of Under Secretary of Defense for
Research and Engineering
Science and Technology Program Protection

== Our Mission	

== Threats to Our Mission
* All protection mechanisms connected to Licit * Illicit Teachnology Transfrer Mechansims
** WRT to attack surfaces
** Interesting effects -- Paperwork Reduction Act (push out)
** Secure Software Memo -- FAR language is being modified
*** Industry CAN have a say!
*** Same with DFARS

== Technology and Program Protection Planning (PPP) ACross the Lifecycle

Example: Systems Security Sustainment 

== Systems Secuirty Mission and Priorities
* Push on policy
* Look as security engineering side

== Technology and Program Protection to Maintain Technological Advantage
* Discussion on Contracting and program offices -- and the impct there of 

== Technology and Program Protection Guidebook
* Guidance for DoDI 5000.83
* PPP in DAG (chpater 9) is BROKEN OUT!

== DoDI 5200.44 - Trusted Systems and Networks
Updated based on new DoD org structure
* related to E.O. on secure software

== JFAC -
Skipped to NEXT session!

== Anti-Tamper: DoDD 5200 47E
* Kicked off CPI working group

== Timeline/laydown of capes/resources
* Alignment to AAF
* 

== Engineering Cyber Resilient Weapon Systems Workshop Series
* CRWSWS? or CRWS?
** "Crews" or "Cruise"

Question: 
SBIRS -- 
"Due Dillegence" -- it's under revision (target in May)
* PPP - NACK (as expected)
* S&T -- maybe
** SBIR III (vs. I/II)

== Secure Cyber Resillient Engineering Design Code
* White Paper series!

== Workforce Competency 
* Working with DAU

== Summary
* Great value working with Industry
* All feedback is GOOD feedback
