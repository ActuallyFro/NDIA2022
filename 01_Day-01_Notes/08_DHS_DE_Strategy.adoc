= Digital Engineering Strategy for DHS

== Topics 
* Context
* DE Transformation
* Pilot 

== Context: DHS S&T Directorrate
* Established in 2003
* Office and Science & Engineering 
** Indepenent techincal acqusition
** 

== Context: Evloition of SE
* Move from linear/stovepiped
* to collaborative/dynamic approach
** getting after changing environemnts

== Context: Motivation for DE
* BEGINING TO LOOK AT THIS!
* LEveraged MITRE and 

== Context: Motivation for DE
* We don't have a timeline for the tools
* BECAUSE we need the workforce
** It's GOING TO BE LONG TIME
** This drives a strategy change!
* DHS is pushing the BENEFITS
** Use case, and example needed!
** To convice self and others of needing to do DE
* 1) MOST major programs are COTS solutions
** The main reality 
* 2) We are growing/evolving -- BUT it's reactionary to threats

In the govt' "we live above the line" -- Contractors 
Below "org level" (sp) we do NOT have visability

Key Question: How does this generate value?
* We try to get COTS, and DEPLOY it FAST
** They might not be able to affect engineering
* Are there Measures of Effectiveness to trace to spec
** Then leverage DE impact?

== Digital Engineering Transformation
MOST IMPORTANT PIECE: for "our digital strategy" -- we "have to BUY IT"
** DE-as-a-Service
* Has to be a value proposition (see bullet 1)
* Ready policy/directives/etc. -- and it really won't drive or incentivise change
* Other places approach
** it's going to be A LONG TIME
** We can't keep up; market place and opensource are going FAST!
* some incentive (make it where ANY PM can put it there -- even as RFPs in evlautation 
** leverage market forces

This is proposed and set out to do

== Pilot Project
* Reach out to FFRDCs -- can this be replicated?
* 
* Issues in 

** USED MITRE**

Digital Engineering Platform
* DHS CANNOT Duplicate this

== Conclusion
* It's a TOOL for decision making 
* It WORKED with Performer + MITRE/DE + DHS -- that was a secret sauce
** ID'ed techincal risk early on, and mitigated it

Key challenge:
* Right skills to execute
* Right metric (dollars, time, etc. -- the senior leader sticker)

== Question
* Time?
** There was a BUNCH of time that was slow rolloed
* 8 Months -- 12 months + contract

* International partners?
** negative -- just US

* Contracting Langauge?
** Dealing with FFRDC -- MORE felxibility
** Strategy of putting in RFP (they asked programs to capture SoW -- put into techincal data package)
*** this CAN drive costs for RAW data
*** VERSUS "decision"

== Actions 
[  ] TASK -- follow-up with the team & find MITRE POC
